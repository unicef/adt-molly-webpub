  "sec_p5_s0_eli5": "ELI5 explanation:\n- Three friends\u2014Leroy, Lenny, and David\u2014are the best jumpers in their team called the Hopper Club. Think of them like the superhero hoppers of their club.\n- The pictures show a hopper zooming forward and flying over a high bar, then landing safely on a soft red mat. That\u2019s how good their jumping is.\n- But Leroy has another plan on Friday: he has to play cricket, a bat-and-ball game. So on Friday he can\u2019t do the Hopper Club jumping because he\u2019ll be at his cricket game.",
  "sec_p6_s0_eli5": "- Who: Molly Hopper.\n- What: She has to take Leroy\u2019s place, like when your friend can\u2019t play and you have to join the team.\n- Problem: Molly is not a very good jumper.\n- Feeling: She is afraid all the time about doing it.\n- What the pictures show: A kid bug jumping, another holding a bat for a game, and Molly sitting with a worried face, hugging her knees\u2014she\u2019s imagining the big jump and feeling scared.\n- Big idea: Sometimes we must try something even when we\u2019re scared, like Molly taking Leroy\u2019s place even though jumping is hard for her.",
  "sec_p7_s0_eli5": "- Molly Hopper feels afraid to jump.\n- There are three jumping games: jump high, jump long, and a potato sack race (you stand inside a big bag and hop like a bunny).\n- In the picture, Molly and her bug friends wear blue shirts and red shorts and look worried.\n- If Molly doesn\u2019t try to jump, the other team, the Croaker Club, may win all three prizes for jumping.\nBig idea: Sometimes we feel scared, but trying helps your team and keeps the prizes from going to the other club.",
  "sec_p8_s0_eli5": "Think of two frog teams at a sports day. Last year, the Croaker Club won all three prizes \u2014 they got all the shiny trophies. Now, Leroy, Lenny, and David tell their friend Molly to stop being afraid so she can help their team. The Hopper Club wants to win the prizes this time. In the picture, you see the golden trophies and the frogs looking ready to try their best.",
  "sec_p9_s0_eli5": "Think of the Hopper Club like a little team of friends. They are having a meeting at Lenny Hopper\u2019s house, sitting in the living room.\n\nLenny\u2019s mother peeks in holding a bag. She says, \u201cChildren, I\u2019m going next door for some seeds.\u201d She reminds them: when the meeting is finished, they can go outside and practise\u2014like a team talks first, then practises after.\n\nSo the message is: meet first inside, then go outside and practise while Mom is just next door getting seeds.",
  "sec_p10_s0_eli5": "- After the meeting, Molly looks out the window and sees it is raining.\n- She says, \u201cOh, no,\u201d because rain sounds like bad news: they can\u2019t go outside to practise.\n- But Molly is actually happy inside. The rain cancels practise, so she can stay indoors and rest.\n- Think of it like when you secretly smile because heavy rain means no outside game at school. The rain is her excuse not to practise."
